Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) - Bread Improver

Ascorbic acid (L-ascorbic acid, vitamin C) is an oxidizing agent used in bread making to improve dough handling properties, crumb structure, and fermentation kinetics. It acts as a dough conditioner through oxidation-reduction reactions.

Recommended Dosage:
- Bread production: 50-200 ppm (0.005-0.02% w/w)
- Standard practice: 50-100 ppm for optimal effect
- Weak flour compensation: 100-200 ppm
- Industrial sandwich bread: 50-75 ppm
- Artisan bread: 25-50 ppm

Mechanisms of Action:
- Strengthens gluten network through disulfide bond formation
- Increases dough elasticity and gas retention capacity
- Accelerates dough fermentation
- Improves crumb uniformity and fineness
- Reduces dough extensibility (counterbalance to enzymes)
- Enhances final bread volume and symmetry

Quality Improvements Observed:
- Better gas-holding capacity of dough
- More uniform crumb structure
- Improved bread crumb color (whiter appearance)
- Enhanced shelf-life through moisture stability
- Reduced dough mixing time requirements
- Better dough machinability

Optimal Conditions:
- pH range: 4.5-6.5 (optimal around 5.0-5.5)
- Temperature: Most effective at fermentation temperatures (25-28°C)
- Redox balance: Works best with oxidizing enzyme systems

Interactions with Other Improvers:
- Synergistic with alpha-amylase and xylanase
- Balances the dough-relaxing effect of enzymes
- Compatible with sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate (SSL)
- May reduce effectiveness if combined with reducing agents
- Effective in system with lipases

Regulatory Notes:
- GRAS status in USA (Generally Recognized As Safe)
- Permitted in most countries under food additive regulations
- Dissolves readily in water for pre-mixing
- Sensitive to pH extremes (degrades in alkaline solutions)

Application Method:
- Mix with flour before hydration for even distribution
- Use aqueous solutions at 1-2% concentration for large batches
- Pre-blend to prevent localized oxidation
- Storage: Keep in cool, dry environment (ascorbic acid is moisture-sensitive)
