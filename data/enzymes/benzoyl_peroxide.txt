Benzoyl Peroxide - Flour Bleaching and Dough Improver

Benzoyl peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent used in flour treatment to improve bleaching and dough conditioning properties. It is also used as a dough improver to strengthen gluten and enhance bread quality.

Recommended Dosage:
- Flour bleaching: 10-75 ppm (varies by regulation)
- USA standard: Typically 10-15 ppm for flour bleaching
- EU regulations: More restrictive (banned or limited)
- Dough improvement effect: 5-20 ppm

Functions:
- Flour bleaching: Oxidizes natural pigments (carotenoids) in flour
- Gluten strengthening: Cross-links gluten proteins through oxidation
- Dough conditioning: Improves elasticity and gas retention
- Oxidative maturation acceleration of flour
- Reduction of mixing time requirements
- Enhancement of dough machinability and stability

Chemical Action:
- Radical oxidation mechanism
- Produces benzoic acid as decomposition product
- Acts independently of enzyme systems
- Most effective in moderately acidic pH (4.5-5.5)
- Temperature-dependent decomposition rate

Flour Bleaching Effects:
- Converts yellow pigments to colorless compounds
- Produces whiter flour appearance
- Improves bakery product visual appeal
- Age-like maturation of flour properties

Regulatory Status:
- GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) in USA with restrictions
- Restricted or banned in EU (many countries have phase-out)
- Canada: Approved for flour bleaching
- Australia/New Zealand: Limited approval
- Always verify local regulations before use

Differences from Ascorbic Acid:
- Stronger oxidizing power
- Longer shelf-life when stored properly
- Does not provide nutritional vitamin benefit
- May have residual taste in some applications
- Higher regulatory scrutiny in some markets

Application Precautions:
- Handle as hazardous material (fire risk)
- Store in cool, dry environment away from organic materials
- Avoid contact with skin; wear protective equipment
- Explosion risk if mishandled (oxidizer safety protocols)
- Decomposition accelerates above 50°C
- Use appropriate dust prevention measures

Quality Outcomes:
- Improved loaf volume (8-12% increase typical)
- Better crumb structure uniformity
- Enhanced crust color development
- Improved dough handling characteristics
- Faster production throughput due to reduced mixing

Alternatives:
- Ascorbic acid (gentler oxidizer, food-derived)
- Enzymes (alpha-amylase, xylanase for natural improvement)
- Potassium bromate (stronger, also restricted in many regions)
- Azodicarbonamide (restricted/banned in many countries)
