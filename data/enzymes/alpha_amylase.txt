Alpha-Amylase (AMY1) - Baking Enzyme

Alpha-amylase is an endoglycosidase enzyme that cleaves α-1,4-glycosidic bonds in starch molecules. In bakery applications, alpha-amylase is used to improve dough extensibility, fermentation rate, and final bread quality.

Recommended Dosage:
- Bread applications: 50-100 ppm (parts per million) of enzyme activity units
- High-volume production: 100-200 ppm for extended dough life
- Weak flour compensation: 150-300 ppm

Functions:
- Reduces starch viscosity in dough
- Increases fermentation substrate (maltose) for yeast
- Improves crumb structure and elasticity
- Extends dough development time
- Enhances bread softness and shelf-life

Temperature Stability:
- Optimal activity: 50-65°C
- Inactivation: Above 80°C for most sources

Interactions:
- Works synergistically with xylanase
- Compatible with ascorbic acid
- May reduce dough stability if overdosed
- Sensitive to pH variations (optimal: 4.5-5.5)

Application Notes:
- Pre-blend with flour before hydration
- Monitor fermentation time due to increased sugar availability
- Particularly effective in weak flour systems
- Results in better volume and softer crumb in sandwich bread
