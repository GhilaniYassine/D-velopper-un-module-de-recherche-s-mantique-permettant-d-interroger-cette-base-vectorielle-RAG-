Xylanase - Hemicellulase Enzyme for Baking

Xylanase is an endo-1,4-β-xylanase that degrades arabinoxylan (AX) and xylan polymers found in cereal grains. In bread making, xylanase modifies the arabinoxylan matrix in flour, improving water absorption and dough rheology.

Recommended Dosage:
- Standard bread: 50-150 ppm activity units (AU/g)
- Weak or damaged starch flour: 100-200 ppm
- Whole wheat bread: 150-300 ppm
- Pastry dough: 25-75 ppm

Functions:
- Improves water absorption of dough
- Increases dough viscosity and stability
- Enhances dough elasticity
- Allows reduction in dough mixing time
- Improves crumb fineness and uniformity
- Increases bread volume
- Extends shelf-life through moisture retention

Synergistic Effects:
- Complements alpha-amylase action
- Works with lipase for emulsification
- Compatible with ascorbic acid
- Reduces need for chemical oxidizing agents

Temperature Profile:
- Optimal temperature: 50-60°C
- Stability range: 45-75°C
- Deactivation temperature: 85°C+

Specific Applications:
- Whole grain breads: Improves crumb structure
- Sandwich bread: Extends shelf-life by 1-2 days
- Artisan bread: Reduces mixing requirements
- Defective flour compensation: Corrects weak flour issues

Dosing Considerations:
- Excessive xylanase can reduce dough stability
- Individual enzyme source variability requires optimization
- Interaction with other improvers should be tested
